# Travel Log

## Description

You've been traveling all over the world by car. Once in a while you log your current location into your travelLog. If you do know where you are, you write the name of the location. If you don't know the name of the place you're at, you just write the latitude and longitude of your location in the log. Both the latitude and longitude are expressed in decimal degrees.

Given the travelLog, find the distance in meters that you've traveled by car, starting from the place from the first travelLog entry and ending at the location of the last travelLog entry.
